    "In few-shot learning tasks, you give the model an instruction, a few query-response examples of how to follow that instruction, and then a new query.  The model must generate the response for that new query.  This technique has pros and cons: it is very powerful and allows models to be reused for many more applications, but it can be finicky and require significant prompt engineering to get good and reliable results.\n",

    "**Background reading**: See the [Wikipedia page on few-shot learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Few-shot_learning_&#40;natural_language_processing&#41;) or [this Hugging Face blog about few-shot learning](https://huggingface.co/blog/few-shot-learning-gpt-neo-and-inference-api).\n",

However, you will see how few-shot learning allows us to specify custom labels, whereas the previous model was tuned for a specific set of labels.  We will also show other (toy) tasks at the end.  In terms of the Hugging Face `task` specified in the `pipeline` constructor, few-shot learning is handled as a `text-generation` task.\n",

It is a transformer model with 1.3 billion parameters developed by Eleuther AI.

    "#### Search and sampling in inference\n",
    "You may see parameters like `num_beams`, `do_sample`, etc. specified in Hugging Face pipelines.  These are inference configurations.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs work by predicting (generating) the next token, then the next, and so on.  The goal is to generate a high probability sequence of tokens, which is essentially a search through the (enormous) space of potential sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this search, LLMs use one of two main methods:\n",
    "* **Search**: Given the tokens generated so far, pick the next most likely token in a \"search.\"\n",
    "  * **Greedy search** (default): Pick the single next most likely token in a greedy search.\n",
    "  * **Beam search**: Greedy search can be extended via beam search, which searches down several sequence paths, via the parameter `num_beams`.\n",
    "* **Sampling**: Given the tokens generated so far, pick the next token by sampling from the predicted distribution of tokens.\n",
    "  * **Top-K sampling**: The parameter `top_k` modifies sampling by limiting it to the `k` most likely tokens.\n",
    "  * **Top-p sampling**: The parameter `top_p` modifies sampling by limiting it to the most likely tokens up to probability mass `p`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can toggle between search and sampling via parameter `do_sample`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more background on search and sampling, see [this Hugging Face blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-generate).\n",
